## by Yannick Coopman, Jonathan Deschuyteneer, Olivia Fantinel

In this workshop, you'll learn how to install and use three.js ! 

Three.js is a powerful tool that makes use of WebGL to render 3D computer animations in HTML canvas and without much efforts. The source code can be found (here)[https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/].

## How to install and use three.js on my web page ?

1. Begin your project in your localhost (to avoid CORS problems) by making those files inside your project folder :

![files](./screenshots/files.png)

2. Do the following commands in your project folder : `npm init` and `npm install three`. If done correctly, you should have a package.json and a package-lock.json files, as well as a node_modules folder.
